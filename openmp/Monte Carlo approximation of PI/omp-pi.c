% HPC - Monte Carlo approximation of $\pi$

The file [omp-pi.c](omp-pi.c) contains a serial program for computing
the approximate value of $\pi$ using a Monte Carlo algorithm. These
algorithms use pseudo-random numbers to compute an approximation of
some quantity of interest.

![Figure 1: Monte Carlo computation of the value of $\pi$](pi_Monte_Carlo.svg)

The idea is quite simple (see Figure 1). We generate $N$ random points
uniformly distributed inside the square with corners at $(-1, -1)$ and
$(1, 1)$. Let $x$ be the number of points that fall inside the circle
inscribed in the square; then, the ratio $x / N$ is an approximation
of the ratio between the area of the circle and the area of the
square. Since the area of the circle is $\pi$ and the area of the
square is $4$, we have $x/N \approx \pi / 4$ which yelds $\pi \approx
4x / N$. This estimate becomes more accurate as we generate
more points.

The goal of this exercise is to modify the serial program to make use
of shared-memory parallelism with OpenMP.

## The hard (and inefficient) way

aStart with a version that uses the `omp parallel` construct. Let $P$
be the number of OpenMP threads; then, the program operates as
follows:

1. The user specifies the number $N$ of points to generate as a
   command-line parameter, and the number $P$ of OpenMP threads using
   the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable.

2. Thread $p$ generates $N/P$ points using the provided function
   `generate_points()`, and stores the result in `inside[p]` where
   `inside[]` is an integer array of length $P$. The array must be
   declared outside the parallel region since it must be shared across
   all OpenMP threads.

3. At the end of the parallel region, the master (thread 0) computes
   the sum of the values in the `inside[]` array, and from that value
   the approximation of $\pi$.

You may initially assume that the number of points $N$ is an integer
multiple of $P$; when you get a working program, relax this assumption
to make the computation correct for any value of $N$.

## The better way

A better approach is to let the compiler parallelize the "for" loop
inside function `generate_points()` using the `omp parallel` and `omp
for` constructs. Note that there is a small issue with this exercise:
since the `rand()` function is non-reentrant, it can not be used
concurrently by multiple threads. Therefore, we use `rand_r()` which
_is_ reentrant but requires that each thread keeps a local state
`seed` and pass it explicitly. The simplest way to allocate and
initialize a private copy of `seed` is to split the `omp parallel` and
`omp for` directives, as follows:

```C
#pragma omp parallel default(none) shared(n, n_inside)
{
        const int my_id = omp_get_thread_num();
        unsigned int my_seed = 17 + 19*my_id;
        ...
#pragma omp for reduction(+:n_inside)
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
                \/\* call rand_r(&seed) here... \*\/
                ...
        }
        ...
}
```

Compile with:

        gcc -std=c99 -fopenmp -Wall -Wpedantic omp-pi.c -o omp-pi -lm

Run with:

        ./omp-pi [N]

For example, to compute the approximate value of $\pi$ using $P=4$
OpenMP threads and $N=20000$ points:

        OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./omp-pi 20000
