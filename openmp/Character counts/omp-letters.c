The file [omp-letters.c](omp-letters.c) contains a serial program that
computes the number of occurrences of each lowercase letter in an
ASCII file read from standard input. The program is case-insensitive,
meaning that uppercase characters are treated as if they were
lowercase; non-letter characters are ignored. We provide some
substantial ASCII documents to experiment with, that have been made
available by the [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/);
despite the fact that these documents have been written by different
authors, the frequencies of characters are quite similar. Indeed, it
is well known that the relative frequencies of characters are
language-dependent and more or less author-independent. You may
experiment with other free books in other languages that are available
on [Project Gutenberg Web site](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

The goal of this exercise is to modify the function `make_hist(text,
hist)` to make use of OpenMP parallelism. The function takes as
parameter a pointer `text` to the whole text, represented as a
zero-terminated C string, and an array `hist[26]` of counts. The array
`hist` is not initialized. At the end, `hist[0]` contains the
occurrences of the letter `a` in the text, `hist[1]` the occurrences
of the letter `b`, up to `hist[25]` that represents the occurrences of
the letter `z`.

A reasonable approach is to partition the text among the OpenMP
threads, so that each thread computes the histogram for part of the
text. Then, all partial histograms needs to be combined to get the
final result.

You might want to start by doing the partitioning manually, i.e.,
without using the `omp for` directive. This is not the most efficient
solution, but is nevertheless instructive; a better approach is
discussed below.

Since the text is a character array of some length $n$, thread $p$ can
compute the extremes of its chunk as:

```C
const int from = (n * p) / num_threads;
const int to = (n * (p+1)) / num_threads;
```

where `num_threads` is the size of OpenMP thread pool. Thread $p$ will
compute the frequencies of the characters in `text[from .. (to-1)]`.

You need to create a shared, two-dimensional array
`local_hist[num_threads][26]` initialized to zero. Thread $p$ operates
on `local_hist[p][]` so that no race conditions are possible. If
thread $p$ sees character $x$, $x \in \{\texttt{'a'}, \ldots,
\texttt{'z'}\}$, it will increase the value `local_hist[p][x - 'a']`.
When all threads are done, the master computes the result as the
column-wise sum of `local_hist`. In other words, the number of
occurrences of character `a` is

$$
\sum_{p=0}^{\texttt{num_threads}-1} \texttt{local_hist}[p][0]
$$

and so on. Also, don't forget that there is a reduction on the counter
`nlet` that reports the number of letters; this might be done using
the `reduction()` clause of the `omp for` directive.

A better and simpler solution can be realized using the `omp parallel
for` directive, and employing array reductions that are available with
OpenMP 4.5 and later (and that we did not discuss during the
class). To perform the sum-reduction on each element of the array
`hist[]` we can use the following syntax:

        #pragma omp parallel for ... reduction(+:hist[:ALPHA_SIZE])

This works as the normal scalar reductions, with the differences that
the compiler actually computes `ALPHA_SIZE` sum-reductions on
`hist[0]`, ... `hist[ALPHA_SIZE - 1]`.

Compile with:

        gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wpedantic -fopenmp omp-letters.c -o omp-letters

Run with:

        ./omp-letters < the-war-of-the-worlds.txt
