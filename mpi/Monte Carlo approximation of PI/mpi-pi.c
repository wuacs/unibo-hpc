% HPC - Monte Carlo approximation of PI

The file [mpi-pi.c](mpi-pi.c) contains a serial program for computing
the approximate value of $\pi$ using a Monte Carlo algorithm. Monte
Carlo algorithms use pseudorandom numbers to compute an approximation
of some quantity of interest.

![Figure 1: Monte Carlo computation of the value of $\pi$](pi_Monte_Carlo.svg)

The idea is quite simple (see Figure 1). We generate $N$ random points
uniformly distributed inside the square with corners at $(-1, -1)$ and
$(1, 1)$. Let $x$ be the number of points that lie inside the circle
inscribed in the square; then, the ratio $x / N$ is an approximation
of the ratio between the area of the circle and the area of the
square. Since the area of the circle is $\pi$ and the area of the
square is $4$, we have $x/N \approx \pi / 4$ which yelds $\pi \approx
4x / N$. This estimate becomes more accurate as the number of points
$N$ increases.

Modify the serial program to parallelize the computation. Several
parallelization strategies are possible, but for now you are advised
to implement the following one ($P$ is the number of MPI processes):

1. Each process gets the value of the number of points $N$ from the
   command line; you may initially assume that $N$ is a multiple of
   $P$, and then relax this requirement to make the program with any
   value of $N$.

2. Each process $p$, including the master, generates $N/P$ random
   points and keeps track of the number $x_p$ of points inside the
   circle;

3. Each process $p > 0$ sends its local value $x_p$ to the master
   using point-to-point send/receive operations.

4. The master receives $x_p$ from all each process $p = 1, \ldots,
   P-1$ (the master already knows $x_0$), computes their sum $x$ and
   the prints the approximate value of $\pi$ as $(4x / N)$.

Step 3 above should be performed using send/receive
operations. However, note that **this is not efficient** and should be
done using the MPI reduction operation that will be introduced in the
next lecture.

To compile:

        mpicc -std=c99 -Wall -Wpedantic mpi-pi.c -o mpi-pi -lm

To execute:

        mpirun -n P ./mpi-pi [N]

Example, using 4 MPI processes:

        mpirun -n 4 ./mpi-pi 1000000
