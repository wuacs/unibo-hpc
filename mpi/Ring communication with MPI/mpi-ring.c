% HPC - Ring communication with MPI

Write a MPI program [mpi-ring.c](mpi-ring.c) that implements a message
exchange along a ring. Let $P$ be the number of MPI processes; the
program should behave according to the following specification:

- The program receives an integer $K \geq 1$ from the command
  line. $K$ is the number of "turns" of the ring. Since all MPI
  processes have access to the command line parameters, they know the
  value $K$ without the need to communicate.

- Process 0 (the master) sends process 1 an integer, whose
  initial value is 1.

- Every process $p$ (including the master) receives a value $v$ from
  the predecessor $p-1$, and sends $(v + 1)$ to the successor
  $p+1$. The predecessor of 0 is $(P - 1)$, and the successor of $(P -
  1)$ is 0.

- The master prints the value received after the $K$-th iteration and
  the program terminates. Given the number $P$ of processes and the
  value of $K$, what value should be printed by the master?

For example, if $K = 2$ and there are $P = 4$ processes, the
communication should be as shown in Figure 1 (arrows are messages
whose content is the number reported above them). There are $K = 2$
turns of the ring; at the end, process 0 receives and prints 8.

To compile:

        mpicc -std=c99 -Wall -Wpedantic mpi-ring.c -o mpi-ring

To execute:

        mpirun -n 4 ./mpi-ring
