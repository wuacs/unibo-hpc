% HPC - Array reversal with CUDA

Write a program that reverses an array `v[]` of length $n$, i.e.,
exchanges `v[0]` and `v[n-1]`, `v[1]` and `v[n-2]` and so on. You
should write the following functions:

1. `reverse()` reverses an array `in[]` into a different array `out[]`
   (the input is not modified). Assume that `in[]` and `out[]` reside
   on non-overlapping memory blocks.

2. `inplace_reverse()` reverses the array `in[]` "in place", i.e.,
   exchanging elements using $O(1)$ additional storage; therefore, you
   are not allowed to allocate a temporary output vector.

The file [cuda-reverse.cu](cuda-reverse.cu) provides a serial
implementation of `reverse()` and `inplace_reverse()`. Your goal is to
odify the functions to use of the GPU, defining any additional kernel
that is required.

## Hints

`reverse()` can be parallelized by launching $n$ CUDA threads; each
thread copies a single element from the input to the output
array. Since the array size $n$ can be large, you should create as
many one-dimensional _thread blocks_ as needed to have at least $n$
threads. Have a look at the lecture notes on how to do this.

`inplace_reverse()` can be parallelized by launching $\lfloor n/2
\rfloor$ CUDA threads (note the rounding): each thread swaps an
element on the first half of `in[]` with the corresponding element on
the second half.

To map threads to array elements it is possible to use the expression:

```C
const int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
```

In both cases the program might create more threads than actually
needed; special care should be made to ensure that the extra threads
do nothing, e.g., using

```C
if (idx < n) {
  \/\* body \*\/
}
\/\* else do nothing \*\/
```

for `reverse()`, and

```C
if (idx < n/2) {
  \/\* body \*\/
}
\/\* else do nothing \*\/
```

for `inplace_reverse()`.

To compile:

        nvcc cuda-reverse.cu -o cuda-reverse

To execute:

        ./cuda-reverse [n]

Example:

        ./cuda-reverse
